== Semantic Versioning

We _must_ follow Semantic Versioning rules when publishing packages, and
especially:

- Never publish breaking changes, including regarding tooling and installation,
  between two versions of the same MAJOR.
- Keep the semantics right between MINOR and PATCHES. MINORs convey new
  features while patches convey fixes.

If you have a doubt, read the Semantic Versioning standard,
v2.0 at https://semver.org. It's not that long.

== Branching

=== Development branches

The branching system is highly coupled with Semantic Versioning. We support
backporting fixes to different MAJOR versions. To do so, we adopt the following
conventions:

- `master` is the ultimate development branch for the upmost MAJOR, accepting
  PRs, fixes, new features... etc.
- Any development branch for a MAJOR strictly inferior to master's MAJOR will
have a name composed with the following pattern:
+
```
dev/MAJOR.x
```

These development branches will be used to cherry-pick backports from `master`.

=== Release branches

NOTE: Release branches target a MAJOR.MINOR release. Patches within
this minor will get merged. This is especially useful to hold references to
documentation for a specific release while accounting for the fact it can be a
moving target.

Release branches have a name composed with the following pattern:

```
release/MAJOR.MINOR
```

=== Transient branches

[WARNING]
Transient branches should never be worked on by more than one person at a
time, unless authors are completely aware of their collaboration.

[NOTE]
Transient branches should be based on master and rebased before merging to `master`.
They should be deleted after merged to master.

These branches are meant for short-term development cycles such as pull
requests. These branches' names should follow the following pattern:

```
PREFIX/QUALIFIER
```

[cols=4*,options=header,frame=topbot]
|===
|PREFIX
|Description
|QUALIFIER
|Examples

|`feat`
|New features
|The issue number this feat will cover, or a slug summarizing the feature
|`feat/001` +
`feat/inline-css`

|`fix`
|Bug fixes
|The issue number this fix will address, or a slug summarizing this fix.
|`fix/001` +
`fix/start-attribute`

|`reg`
|(Anti) regression tests
|The issue number this test will reproduce.
|`reg/001`

|`tests`
|Coverage or other tests
|A slug summarizing the areas covered by the test(s).
|`tests/image-renderer`

|`rfc`
|Requests For Comments
|A slug summarizing the area covered by the RFC.
|`rfc/whitespaces`

|`opt`
|Optimizations
|The issue number this optimization will address, or a slug summarizing the
optimization.
|`opt/103` +
`opt/rendering-cycles`
|===

== Publishing

[CAUTION]
Pre-releases should be prepared from `master` or `dev/MINOR.x` (cf,
xref:branching[Branching]).

The publishing cycle entails pre-releases, which are usually tagged on npm with
`next`. The table below describes the relationship between releases names,
npm tags and their semantics. Custom npm tags can also be used to denote a new
MAJOR version in early-stage development.

[cols=4*,options=header,frame=topbot]
|===
|Release type
|Npm tag
|Version suffix
|Description

|Unstable
|`unstable`
|`-alpha.x`
|Features and API can evolve.

|Frozen
|`next`
|`-beta.x`
|Features are frozen. Eventually, new fixes and optimizations can be merged.

|Stable
|`latest` +
`release/MAJOR.MINOR`
|_none_
|Stable releases.

=== Pre-releases

==== Prerequisites

- [ ] Tests are passing;
- [ ] I'm on the `master` (or a `dev/MINOR.x` branch if I'm backporting fixes);
- [ ] If the release is frozen, I've updated the changelog with a `next` entry;
- [ ] I have changed the version in  `package.json`;
- [ ] I have commited my changes;
- [ ] I have tagged this very commit with `v<semver>`, replacing `<semver>`
with the version in `package.json`.

==== Steps

1. Consider the appropriate npm `tag` for this version with the table above.
2. Run the following command--replace `<tag>` with your tag:
+
```
npm publish --tag <tag>
```
3. Publish your changes to origin
+
```
git push
```
4. Publish the new git tag to origin
+
```
git push --tags
```
5. Create a new issue on Github to be pinned, asking for feedback for this
pre-release. This issue must have the `release` label.
6. Create a new pre-release on github, and copy and paste the content of the
CHANGELOG. Also, link the issue previously created to ask for feedback.

=== Releases

==== Prerequisites

- [ ] Tests are passing;
- [ ] I'm on the `master` (or a `dev/MINOR.x` branch if I'm backporting fixes);
- [ ] I've updated the changelog with a `<version>` entry;
- [ ] I have changed the version in `package.json`;
- [ ] I have commited my changes;
- [ ] I have tagged this very commit with `v<semver>`, replacing `<semver>`
with the version in `package.json`.

==== Steps

1. Publish to npm:
+
```
npm publish
```
2. Update the `release/MAJOR.MINOR` npm tag (this tag is important for documentation)
+
```
npm dist-tag add react-native-render-html@MAJOR.MINOR.VERSION release/MAJOR.MINOR 
```
3. Publish your changes to origin
+
```
git push
```
4. Publish the new git tag to origin
+
```
git push --tags
```
5. Create a new release on github, and copy and paste the content of the
approriate section in the CHANGELOG.


*If this publication was a backport (from a `dev/MINOR.x` branch), you must
cherry-pick the version commit into master.*

A. Checkout and pull master
+
```
git switch master
git pull
```
B. Cherry-pick the commit you have previously made on `dev/MINOR.x` branch.
+
```
git cherry-pick <commit-id>
```
If you must resolve conflicts, make sure:

- [ ] The new changelog entry is positionned in the approriate order;
- [ ] The `package.json` version remains the upmost.
